We had just discovered this website a few weeks before after I had discovered that every popular national campground was booked completely full for Memorial Day weekend. I was ecstatic about it. I was going to be able to find a truly private backyard on a ranch somewhere far away from everyone and everything else. Unfortunately, it didn't occur to me that people could easily claim they owned a piece of property and collect their money before we had even arrived. (Or at least we thought that's what happened)"

We had been doped and had a few hours of day light left."

He was ecstatic about helping us, offering us multiple places to explore camping, his own property, and even a nice cold beer."

It was nearing night, with an hour left of dusk, and neither of us had eaten or relaxed in 15-20 hours. We thought it best to eat and relax first and catch the sunrise the next morning. So, after gathering more firewood, slicing up some vegetables and tofu, and roasting them as kabobs over the fire, we sat back in some chairs with a beer and cigar and chatted until midnight. This is when the true adventure began."

Seeing as how we were using our sleeping bags as padding from the hard ground, all we had was a thin fleece blanket to snuggle underneath. Through shivers, eery dark quietness, and being awake for ~20 hours, we managed to fall into a deep sleep."

As I nervously, half awake, and in the dark, wait quietly, I suddenly hear an excruciating gagging sound from her. At that instant, I can taste the overly spiced kabobs on my tongue. 'It must be the food. I over spiced it.' I say to myself. Secretly, I was just hoping it wasn't altitude sickness. After a lot of pleading, I get her back into the tent and convince her I am just a crappy cook."

With only the light of the moon, I rip the tent out of the ground and grab the various tools and supplies laying around our campsite to throw them into the back of the car."

However, I was able to get out of the half-mile road after about an hour of pushing, sweating, and using abusive language."

So, I completely and utterly pass out from exhaustion and don't wake up until 4 in the afternoon."
