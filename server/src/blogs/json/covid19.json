I barely had time to catch my \nbreath after coming back from a trip from Oahu, Hawaii, when all of a sudden, \neverything around me was shutting down.</p>\n<p>So in an effort to stay informed, I quickly created a visualizer to view just how \nquickly the virus is spreading. I don't have much to say about it now as I am not \na medical professional and I don't have all the answer.</p>\n<p>What I do have is my skills and a dataset. So for now, I hope you can get a better \nunderstanding of the spread of the virus by examining the dataset directly. Please, \nlet me know what else I can provide.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CDC Dataset (Updated Daily)</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jackmead515/blog/tree/master/covid-vis/src\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Source Code</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/plugin/covid19\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Fullscreen COVID-19 Map</a></p>\n<p>Whatever you make of this data, please, listen to the professionals in the medical field. \nThey are the ones who will know the best how this event will play out.</p>\n<p>For now, stay safe. Wash your hands. Don't touch your face. And if you are infected, \nseek out medical help immediately.</p>\n<p>NOTE: if all you see if a black screen that's probably because the map provider I am \nusing is a paid service. I'll see how I can fix that soon.</p>\n<iframe id=\"covid19\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" src=\"/plugin/covid19\">\n</iframe>"
