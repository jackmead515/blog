Why would we want to do that? Here's the problem. Our sensors may have an extremely poor current output characterized by a low current voltage source and high resistance. If our soil sensor has a wire that is 10 feet long (perhaps to make it buried underground) the sensor would be doomed in trying to supply enough DC current! There is another way to say this: our circuit has <b>high impedance</b>."

And the thing about a reference, is that if it's not a stable value, your digital conversion is going to be garbage."

      "contents": "One final note I want to make is the importance of all the capacitors everywhere. Adding capacitors prevents rapid voltage flucuations in your circuit which could damage your components or decrease the accuracy of your sensors. Specifically on the sensor outputs, there is a 0.1 uF ceramic capacitor pulled to ground. If you watch the output on the oscilliscope, with a cap and without, you'll notice that a capacitor will prevent the sensor from receiving a burst of information all of a sudden. Basically, you won't make the sensor less precise, you'll just make the sensor a bit more sluggish. Why would you want to do that?"
    },
    {
      "type": "p",
      "contents": "Well this can help with false readings. For instance, if you have a photo resistor in your circuit that is supposed to detect if it's night out and you don't have a capacitor, very heavy cloud coverage or shadows could give false positives! In a soil sensor reading, a single drop of water on the sensor doesn't mean that the soil is moist. That drop of water could have came from anywhere. Having a large capacitor on your circuit will allow you to water your plant and wait for the water to disperse evenly before the sensor reads your soil."

    {
      "type": "p",
      "contents": "For these examples, a capacitor makes sense. However, as an example, it wouldn't make sense to put capacitors on the sensor of the Large Hadron Collider. When a particle collision occurs, that collision takes place in billionths of a second! Your sensor circuit needs to be extremely sensitive and reactive to the tiny changes."
    },
    {
      "type": "p",
      "contents": "Of course, you don't have to have a capacitor. You could just use software to find the median/average value over a period of time of your choosing. But, a healthy mix of both software and hardware will make your circuit strong. To grasp this topic, I've built a small D3.js plugin to visualize this. Tune the capacitance and noise and watch how the sensor reacts. If there are any questions you have, don't be afraid to ask! Thank you!!"

      "contents": "NOTE: This is my first official electronics tutorial and I wanted to explain how I like to write about electronics. One of the most famous books on electronics is called 'The Art of Electronics'. And I take that to heart. Design circuits is messy and takes more art and practice then math. Although I know how to do a lot of the maths (not very well) I prefer to write in terms on how I build the circuit. I understand what component does what to the circuit and then I make an educated guess as to how many units that component should be. Then, I make fine tune adjustments until it works exactly as how I'd like it too. That all being said, it is still very important to understand the mathematics involved."
