Wow. The world is really freaking out over this. I barely had time to catch my 
breath after coming back from a trip from Oahu, Hawaii, when all of a sudden, 
everything around me was shutting down.

So in an effort to stay informed, I quickly created a visualizer to view just how 
quickly the virus is spreading. I don't have much to say about it now as I am not 
a medical professional and I don't have all the answer.

What I do have is my skills and a dataset. So for now, I hope you can get a better 
understanding of the spread of the virus by examining the dataset directly. Please, 
let me know what else I can provide.

Whatever you make of this data, please, listen to the professionals in the medical field. 
They are the ones who will know the best how this event will play out.

For now, stay safe. Wash your hands. Don't touch your face. And if you are infected, 
seek out medical help immediately.

NOTE: if all you see if a black screen that's probably because the map provider I am 
using is a paid service. I'll see how I can fix that soon.
